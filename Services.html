                    <p>Responsive web design is a fundamental approach to creating websites that adapt and scale
                        gracefully across various devices and screen sizes. It ensures that users can enjoy a
                        consistent and user-friendly experience, whether they're accessing a website on a desktop
                        computer, tablet, or smartphone</p>
